"what next?" - simple command-line task-interdependency tracker

To run wn, you need [Lua](http://lua.org). That's it.

Think of wn as `make` for your to-do list. It automatically tracks what
should be worked on next when switching between several ongoing projects.

wn reads a text file of tasks and dependencies, then prioritizes your
to-do list according to the other tasks that would be doable upon completion.

wn checks (in order) for a wn file given on the command line, a file
called ".wn" in the current directory, then the $WN_FILE environment
variable, then "~/.wn". The file should be structured like so:

    shoes socks find-shoes
    @desc shoes Put on shoes   (descriptions are optional)
    socks

The first token on a line is a task name, any following are dependencies
for that task. Task names can contain alphanumeric chars and [_.-].

The line can also begin with some special commands, all of which begin with @:

    @desc taskname Add a description for a task
    @done taskname (mark tags as complete)
    @cost taskname cost (change task cost, defaults to 10)
    @value taskname value (change task priority, defaults to 10)
    @wait taskname [timestamp] (keep leaf inactive until provided date)

Lines that begin with anything else (or are empty) are ignored as comments.

For a larger example, see examples/lebowski (*spoiler alert*).

Command line options:

 * `-v / --verbose`: Print actions taken while reading input file
 * `-h / --help`:    Print commands
 * `-f / --file`:    Use the filename given as the wn file

Commands: 

 * `add`:    Add a new task (with optional description), creating wn file if not present
 * `dep`:    Add new dependencies to a task (`wn.lua dep task dep1 dep2 ...`)
 * `done`:   Flag a task as done (`wn.lua done taskname`)
 * `graph`:  Generate .dot of dependency graph for Graphviz
 * `help`:   Print this info
 * `info`:   Print info about a task (`wn.lua info taskname`)
 * `leaves`: Print all leaves, sorted alphabetically
 * `next`:   (default) Print next actionable tasks, sorted by score
 * `tasks`:  Print all incomplete tasks, sorted alphabetically

To build a nice dependency graph, use e.g. `wn.lua graph | neato -Tpng > foo.png` . (which requires [Graphviz](http://graphviz.org/))
